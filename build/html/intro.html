<h2>What GraspIt! is<a class="headerlink" href="#what-graspit-is" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>GraspIt! was created to serve as a tool for grasping research. It is a
simulator that can accommodate arbitrary hand and robot designs. It can
also load objects and obstacles of arbitrary geometry to populate a
complete simulation world. The GraspIt! engine includes a rapid
collision detection and contact determination system that allows a user
to interactively manipulate a robot or an object and create contacts
between them. Once a grasp is created, one of the key features of the
simulator is the set of grasp quality metrics. Each grasp is evaluated
with numeric quality measures, and visualization methods allow the user
to see the weak point of the grasp and create arbitrary 3D projections
of the 6D grasp wrench space.</p>
<p>In our experience, we have found that GraspIt! usually serves one of two
purposes. First, it can be used as a development tool, to execute and
test various robot control algorithms. In this sense, it serves as a
replacement for the real world: in simulation, an algorithm can be
tested on many hand designs, many objects and obstacle configurations,
at no cost and much faster than in the real world. Second, GraspIt! can
be used as a computational platform that backs up a robot that does
operate in the real world. For example, a real robot can acquire a model
of a target object, then use GraspIt! to quickly evaluate multiple
grasping or manipulation scenarios. Often, these scenarios are also
combined and the same GraspIt! setup used for development of an
algorithm can also be used for computations during real life execution.</p>
<p>GraspIt! has many features that help accomplish these roles; all of
these features are documented in the second part of this manual. The
most commonly used include the contact detection and grasp quality
metrics mentioned above, the dynamics engine and the grasp planning
capabilities. The dynamics engine within GraspIt! computes the motions
of a group of connected robot elements, such as an arm and a hand, under
the influence of controlled motor forces, joint constraint forces,
contact forces and external forces. This allows a user to dynamically
simulate an entire grasping task, as well as test custom robot control
algorithms. The grasp planning algorithms rely on the simulated
environment to quickly evaluate many hand postures, and find those that
lead to stable grasps. There are many possible implementations of this
concept; the planners that are included with GraspIt! can usually find
multiple stable grasps of an object in less than 1 minute, taking into
account obstacles and other constraints.</p>
<p>Overall, GraspIt! is an open-source virtual environment for simulating
robotic grasping tasks accompanied by a number of analysis and
development tools. It has been developed in C++ using many other
open-source libraries, and is cross-platform, tested on both Windows and
Ubuntu Linux.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-graspit-is-not">
<h2>What GraspIt! is NOT<a class="headerlink" href="#what-graspit-is-not" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>GraspIt! is not an off-the-shelf product. It is rather a large codebase
that is the result of many years of research and development in the
Robotics Lab at Columbia University. The tools included can greatly help
in the development and testing of new algorithms and approaches.
However, we have often found that most new interesting problems can not
be completely addressed by applying these tools exactly as they are. It
is very possible that, in the process, you will find yourself needing
various changes or additions to the simulator; these might be bigger or
smaller depending on your problem. This means that you might have to get
your hands dirty and tinker with the code itself, which we encourage you
to do. We have done our best to create clean, robust and well-documented
code. However, we are not a large team of product development software
engineers; rather, we are a small group of robotics researchers. As a
result, do not be surprised if you find parts of the code that can be
improved.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="about-this-manual">
<h2>About this manual<a class="headerlink" href="#about-this-manual" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This manual is divided into two parts. The first one, containing
<strong>Chapters 1 through 4</strong>, is an introduction to the GraspIt!
environment, covering the essential aspects for loading and populating a
GraspIt! world and interacting with it. The references to the source
code are kept at a minimum. In the second part, containing <strong>Chapters 5
through 17</strong>, we discuss the GraspIt! advanced features, or the tools
that it offers for solving various problems. Here we overlap discussions
of the simulator as a final product with discussion of the source code
itself. We also introduce a number of features of GraspIt! that are not
completely finished yet, and might not be very robust, but have been
included in the distribution in the hope you might find them useful.
Such features will be marked by the qualifier “Under Development” - only
use them if you’re not afraid of delving inside the code to get the most
out of them and fix an occasional bug.</p>
<p>Please note that, much like the code itself, this manual is under
continuous development. There are many aspects that it does not touch at
all, or explains too briefly. If there is a topic that you found
particularly confusing, or you would like to see expanded, we would
appreciate your feedback.</p>

<div class="section" id="troubleshooting-and-contact">
<h2>Troubleshooting and contact<a class="headerlink" href="#troubleshooting-and-contact" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>GraspIt! includes two main resources: this manual, and a complete code
reference. We have put a lot of work into both of them, and we strongly
encourage you to try using them to solve your problem before contacting
us. If that fails, we will try to provide support via email; write us at
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">graspit&#64;lists.cs.columbia.edu</span></code>. General comments on the simulator,
and any patches or improvements to the code are always appreciated.</p>

<h2>Authors and acknowledgements<a class="headerlink" href="#authors-and-acknowledgements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Andrew Miller</strong> and <strong>Matei Ciocarlie</strong> are the main authors of
GraspIt!, having designed most of its features and implemented most of
the code. GraspIt!’s current main developers and maintainers are Matei
Ciocarlie and <strong>Jon Weisz</strong>. The GraspIt! simulator was developed in the
Robotics Lab, Department of Computer Science, Columbia University, under
the guidance of <strong>Prof. Peter Allen</strong>.</p>
<p>Many people contributed to GraspIt!, either in the form of new ideas,
suggestions or guidance, or by implementing new features in code. These
include: <strong>Prof. Jeff Trinkle</strong>, who provided valuable advice on the
dynamics system; <strong>Danica Kragic</strong> who developed the real time vision
system allowing GraspIt! to work with real robots; <strong>Prof. Henrik
Christensen</strong> and <strong>Steffen Knoop</strong> who helped build the automatic grasp
planner; <strong>Raphael Pelossof</strong>, who implemented the first GraspIt! based
machine learning approach; <strong>Claire Lackner</strong>, who helped design and
implement the soft finger contact algorithms; <strong>Corey Goldfeder</strong>, who
was the driving force behind the Columbia Grasp Database (CGDB) which is
now integrated with GraspIt!; <strong>Hao Dang</strong> who wrote the GraspIt! - CGDB
interface, and made many other valuable contributions to the codebase;
<strong>Norases Vesdapunt</strong>, who wrote the XML interface for data files. We
would like to thank all of them for their valuable contributions.</p>
