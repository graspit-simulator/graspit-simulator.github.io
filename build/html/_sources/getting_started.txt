Getting Started
===============

To get started, use the File->Open menu, and load the
simulation world file ``dlr_flask.wld``. Note that by default GraspIt!
will look for world files in ``$GRASPIT/worlds``. This is a very simple
simulation world containing nothing except a hand (the DLR model) and an
object (a flask).

In general, you can also start with an empty simulation world and
populate it by importing robots and objects, one at a time, using the
Import options in the File menu. You can then save a simulation world
into a world file, like the one that we just opened. In this quick
tutorial, we will be using a couple of simulation worlds supplied with
the distribution.

The main window and controls
----------------------------

The most part of the GraspIt! main window is occupied by the Inventor
viewer, which renders the virtual world. On the right side there is a
vertical toolbar: this is the Inventor toolbar which is responsible for
camera interaction.

The first two buttons on the Inventor toolbar determine which state the
viewer is in.

**Interaction mode**.
This is the only mode in which you can interact with the objects in the
simulation world.

   :width: 10%

**Camera mode**.
This is the only mode in which you can move the camera.

You can also toggle between **Interaction mode** and **Camera mode** by
pressing the ``<ESC>`` or ``<ALT>`` keys, although this seems not to
work on all systems.

The Camera mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the viewer is in **Camera mode**, you can move the virtual camera
in the following ways:

-  **Rotate** - Hold down the left mouse button and drag;

-  **Translate** - Hold down ``<CTRL>`` and the left mouse button and
   drag; alternatively, hold down the middle mouse button and drag;

-  **Zoom** - Hold both the left and middle mouse buttons and drag, or
   rotate the wheel on a wheel mouse.

In addition, the following buttons on the Inventor toolbar are useful:

This automatically moves the camera so that the entire scene fits
in the viewer window;


.. image:: _static/seekTool.jpg
   :width: 10%

The seek tool allows you to click on an object in the scene.
After you click, the camera zooms in on the object, which also
becomes the center of rotation.

Take a moment to move the camera around and familiarize yourself with
its controls.

The Interaction mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the viewer is in **Interaction mode**, you can interact with the
objects in the scene. The type of interaction is determined by the
following buttons in the GraspIt! toolbar:


.. image:: _static/translateTool.jpg
   :width: 10% 

   
-  **Translate or set joints**. Clicking on a body or the base
   (palm) of a robot causes a box to be drawn around it. This box acts
   as a translation manipulator. By clicking on the sides of the box and
   dragging the mouse, the body or robot can be translated in 2
   dimensions that are aligned with the face of the box that was
   clicked. Holding down ``<SHIFT>`` constrains this motion to one axis.
   If a robot is selected and moved.

   Clicking on a kinematic chain causes joint draggers to be drawn for
   each DOF on that chain. You can then use these draggers to move the
   joints of the robot.

.. image:: _static/rotateTool.jpg
   :width: 10%

-  **Rotate**. Clicking a body or robot base link brings up a
   spherical rotation manipulator. Dragging the ball allows rotation of
   the selected item in three dimensions. By clicking one of the
   stripes, the body can be rotated about one axis at a time. By
   dragging the cross hairs, the ball can be re-centered to rotate about
   a different point. The limitations concerning connected robots
   applies to rotation as well.


.. image:: _static/selectTool.jpg
   :width: 10%

-  **Select**. Clicking a body will select it, and this is indicated
   with a wireframe overlay. Holding down ``<SHIFT>`` allows multiple
   bodies to be selected, or clicking on an already selected link of a
   robot will select the whole robot. Once a body (or bodies) has been
   selected, its collision and material properties are shown in the next
   part of the toolbar. They can then be changed or additional
   properties can be changed using the menu item described below. After
   a body is selected, the user may remove the body from the world by
   pressing ``<DEL>``.

Try to use the TranslateTool tool to flex the fingers of the robot. Note that once a
finger touches the object, a contact is marked and no more flexion is
allowed. The same behavior applies for moving objects or robots around.

The following buttons in the GraspIt! toolbar apply to the currently
selected body (if any):

.. image:: _static/collide.jpg
   :width: 10%

-  **Toggle Collisions**. There are 3 different ways to use this
   property:

   -  if no body is selected, this button allows collision checking for
      the entire world to be switched on or off.

   -  if one or more than two bodies are selected, this button sets the
      collision checking for those bodies. A body that has collision
      checking turned off can pass through ANY other body.

   -  if two bodies are selected, this button allows collision checking
      between ONLY that pair of bodies to be disabled.

.. image:: _static/materialSelect.jpg
   :width: 10%

-  **Material**. This sets the material for the selected bodies,
   which affects the coefficient of friction when contacts arise.

Try to disable collisions for the entire simulation world. Note that now
you can move objects or flex fingers freely, even if that results in a
collisions. Make sure you move all objects out of collisions **before**
you re-enable collision checking; otherwise, you will not be able to
move them around.

You can also create one or more contacts between the hand and the
object. Once you have a contact, select one of the bodies in contact
(such as the robot link that is touching the flask, or the flask itself)
and change its material. Notice how the friction cone that marks the
contact changes as well.

Grasp example
-------------

Start by loading the simulation world ``dlr_flask.wld`` again, to make
sure all the world elements are in their original positions. The use the
menu Grasp->Auto Grasp. This will cause all the
fingers of the robot to flex (more details can be found in the ) until
contact with the flask prevents all further motion. You now have a
grasp.

Use the Grasp->Quality Measures... menu to create a
new quality measure that will be used on this grasp. By default, the
quality measure dialog that appears will create a new quality measure
called **New Quality Measure** of the **Epsilon** type using an L1 Grasp
Wrench Space. Click **Add/Edit**, and then click **OK**. The new quality
measure, along with its value, will be displayed in the lower left part
of the GraspIt! main window.

You can also create a projection of the Grasp Wrench Space for this
grasp. Use the Grasp->Create GWS Projection menu.
Then click the three checkboxes marked **tx, ty** and **tz** and click
**OK**. GraspIt! will display the space of forces that this grasp can
apply without a net torque. Note that if you change the camera in the
main GraspIt! viewer, the camera that shows the GWS projection moves as
well. The axes of the GWS projection are always aligned with the axes of
the main viewer.

Dynamics example
----------------

Start by loading the simulation world ``barrettGlassDyn.wld``. Then,
start the dynamics engine by pressing the Â  button on the Dynamics
toolbar. Note that the robot joints move slightly and the glass slowly
rolls on the table. The PD controllers in the robot joints are simply
maintaining the current position against gravity.

Use the Grasp->Auto Grasp menu to close the fingers
of the hand. Note that the hand starts closing, then lifts the glass
into its grasp. After the grasp stabilizes, select the glass and change
its material properties to ``frictionless``. The glass then slips out of
the grasp and ends up rolling off the table. You can pause the dynamics
engine at any time by clicking the pause button in the dynamics toolbar.

The menus
---------

Here is a subset of the functionality in the menus (I hope to update
this section soon):

-  **File Menu**

   -  **New** Empties the current world and resets the simulation time.

   -  **Open...** Loads a new world configuration.

   -  **Save, Save As...** Saves the current world configuration.
      Velocities are not saved.

   -  **Save Image...** Renders the scene using the current camera and
      saves the image in jpg format. The image will be antialiased.

   -  **Import Robot...** Loads a robot from a robot configuration file
      and places it at the world origin. After importing a robot or
      body, click view all if the imported object does not fit in the
      viewer.

   -  **Import Object...** Loads an Inventor model and places it in the
      world as a graspable body. The Inventor file must have mass and
      material defined in the comments. The body is made transparent so
      that contacts can be seen.

   -  **Import Obstacle...** Loads an Inventor model and places it as a
      static object in the world. These objects may be moved by the user
      but their motions are not computed during dynamic simulation.

   -  **Edit Settings...** Allows the user to change persistant program
      settings. The settings are stored in the registry in Windows, and
      in an rc file in Linux. See below for a description of this dialog
      box.

   -  **Exit** Exits the program.

-  **Element**

   -  **Translate** Same as translate toolbar button. See above.

   -  **Rotate** Same as rotate toolbar button. See above.

   -  **Select** Same as select toolbar button. See above.

   -  **Collisions ON/OFF** Same as collision toggle toolbar button. See
      above.

   -  **Body Properties...** Brings up a dialog box that allows the user
      to edit the properties of the currently selected bodies. See below
      for a description of this dialog box.

-  **Grasp**

   -  **Auto Grasp** Starts an auto-grasp. When the dynamics are not
      running, this closes the fingers of a hand until joint limits are
      reached or contacts prevent further motion. The relative velocity
      of the joints is defined in the robot configuration file. When
      dynamics are running, a trajectory generator will create a
      position trajectory that will close the fingers. The joint
      controllers will then use these positions as set points and adjust
      the joint forces.

   -  **Create GWS Projection...** Opens a dialog box to allow the user
      to choose a projection of the 6D grasp wrench space. After the
      projection is chosen, GraspIt! opens a new window showing the
      projected wrench space. The volume is updated each time the grasp
      changes.

   -  **Quality Measures...** Allows the user to create a new quality
      measure that will be evaluated each time the grasp changes. (More
      documentation on this soon.)

   -  **Planner...** Opens a dialog box containing settings for the
      automatic grasp planner. At this time this only works with the
      Barrett hand.
